phrase,class
right here in Maryland ,3
believe me I know there is I lived in Plano and I do n't know if you 're familiar with Plano ,3
unless they 're just absolutely forced to ,3
Oh oh absolutely it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money ,3
and their inability to understand multicultural or multiracial situation ,3
Well there 's real Mexican food and there 's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans ,3
That was so cool and then man she 's really porked out again I guess but ,3
and it worked out wonderfully ,3
Industrial Marketing ,3
and they do it again you know ,3
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she should n't go because she was alone ,3
It 's okay for us to go extend our youth 's lives like so much water in the desert ,3
It 's I do n't see how anyone can afford it ,3
because it you go to different countries and you see in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with Patrick Swayze ,3
but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just can not communicate ,3
I mean no one has said for sure you know ,3
well that 's interesting too Well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo ,3
What what do you call the dog ? ,3
So honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it ,3
No it 's just the like the bees and insects will do it ,3
Oh okay the first person I 've talked to outside of Texas ,3
a parent and that kind of thing because ,3
Good luck on that one then ,3
and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior ,3
And I 've had my cholesterol checked and a few times and I 've never been above like you know one-hundred and fifty ,3
and watch the cats tear it up ,3
You have to what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself ,3
It 's like a slap on the fingers for them ,3
That 's right Not enough people want to do that to ,3
I 've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television ,3
So you can learn a lot that way I there 's no way I could I could fix every car in the world you know ,3
Rub up against the siding ,3
although you still hear about those occasionally ,3
but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone ,3
That there are ways to prevent families you know like basically there 's contraceptives and ,3
instruct- professors from other ,3
Oh it it was it was tremend- well it was about seven hours labor ,3
It makes you more at ease You know you knew you were n't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous ,3
I said good luck on that one then ,3
She 's the most intelligent dog I 've ever seen Course I 'm a little prejudiced of course ,3
and I must say it was interesting ,3
So what kind of neat hobbies do you have ? ,3
That 's why I lucked out my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got ... ,3
And they can stand on their heads if they want too ,3
That 's where I 've seen it because I 've seen it off and on probably ,3
so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn ? ,3
I 've heard it 's pretty cool ,3
I should know something about T V shows ,3
Somebody take care of me ,3
Be- because we 're so we love our freedom ,3
I mean I guess it 'd go with my flowers ,3
You have the seven day waiting period ,3
but you know I look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand ,3
that you think this is n't sinking in ,3
That sounds real good ,3
Well you know if if they have time enough they can ,3
My house is on a main road and it has nothing ,3
Because I mean you as an individual what you do that to me is your business ,3
Well girls at that age ,3
I said you probably have some friends that have television ,3
Once upon a time I was Well I have two dogs those are my kids ,3
I mean things the way we grow are carrots cabbage that sort of MUMBLEx goes to waste ,3
There 's there 's a lot of you know last minute things that happen cause a person not to ,3
But I 've received quite a few ,3
and I mean once the child 's in school if you had a job from say nine to three ,3
But you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and ,3
That 's great But it 's kids that come home and do n't have a mother there ,3
you know all the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that ,3
That 's a plus Oh I have a total of five children I have three left living at home ,3
Well it the the the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech ,3
Okay you know like how these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other ,3
Right I do n't care to go to a place just for the price of it ,3
I agree with you I a group that I 'm a part of goes once a month to a they call it the Heritage House ,3
Easiest way out maybe No I do n't think it 's a monetary thing ,3
That would be really awful ,3
do they have such a thing now as a six man jury ? ,3
Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up ,3
It is what you look for ? ,3
by and large no But but they 're big fun ,3
right So let 's put up with it I guess ,3
the feeling that it MUMBLEx with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know ,3
I like that situation that 's usually real good ,3
I do n't know Unless I knew that they were somewhere just really I mean just really great ,3
camping out and eating out ,3
My God I ca n't imagine ,3
We were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju- It was just before July fourth ,3
franchised restaurants I I I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run ,3
So you know I got my degree and got the better paying job and ,3
So how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all ,3
I I spent a couple years down in Plano Texas ,3
I wa used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons ,3
there 's excuse me there 's bumble patterns there 's mosquito patterns there 's wasp patterns there 's grub patterns ,3
that that was memorable somehow I do n't know what it was ,3
a lot more common sense ,3
Whenever you have a something that looks like something else ,3
And although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but ,3
I mean back then and the show did you see the show where she lost all of that fat ? ,3
do more you know be more community oriented and all ,3
involving a violent crime or anything ,3
and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its ,3
And I just would prefer that I mean sometimes we 've said let 's keep we 're not interested in what other countries do ,3
They can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can ,3
I 've got about twelve tickets in the mail Do you have you 've MUMBLEx a few ? ,3
and our freedom of choice ,3
So I guess from what I understand the thing could just ,3
and we did n't have all that fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop and ,3
and go you are just fantastic ,3
I like the pro actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to MUMBLEx I watch pro football but I like the N B A play-offs ,3
Oh my gosh I 've got to go to Maine then ,3
I just do it all Do I there 's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that I 'll do I ,3
vehemently but it has quieted down but I do n't think they probably feel any differently ,3
my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that 's kind of why we got back after eighteen months ,3
Tha- that 's the way they did it in Alabama too ,3
and they have to shake it off ,3
and having people But you know our like in our church it it is your free to do that or not ,3
because you look at their job description you 'd s- you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and ,3
kind of a waste of a person ,3
No Because inside the jail there I do n't think there 's no real rehabilitation ,3
Oh I 'm from Midland ,3
than these kids that do n't have that responsibility ,3
Did you take kids along ? ,3
There is a difference ,3
You 're working then ? ,3
And you know although I would n't want it MUMBLEx to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but ,3
then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal ? ,3
we 've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman so we usually see like first-rate movies ,3
there you go and then ,3
Oh that 's really weird ,3
You would n't believe it we even raised chickens ,3
you 're encouraged to do it because you know it it helps you and of course we think it 's helping other people ,3
And ready to storm into Saudi Should n't we try and help our friends ? ,3
that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and I the the the whole aspect ,3
and and both of them ,3
you 're doing other things ,3
back when like the Pistons were in them and now where are you calling from ? ,3
And then I did some very mild say light weight lifting Nothing I 'm not trying to make big bulging muscles ,3
and it 's a fly you call it a pattern ,3
I I think that the mother and the child lose and I think that 's why there is so many problems ,3
they would understand how other people live and ,3
is that the crime and it 's already MUMBLEx some chart and determine the punishment or ,3
know but I I still what the stan- flag stands for I guess to me is ,3
Lots and lots of catnip so it 's it 's still green and it 's been two days so I 'm encouraged ,3
and it 's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point ,3
really I 'm kind of open on food I 'm what you might call a culinary adventurer I 'll ,3
That 's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and ,3
and you would think you know being an American or whatever ,3
I think it will be freedom of choice ,3
and they 're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now ,3
And that 's going to it 's going to be really good ,3
It 's just I do n't I do n't know I just ,3
Oh that 's nice mostly catfish or ,3
Unfortunately that 's what happens ,3
so to see if it 's a female they say well do you carry a purse and Pat says no I carry a fanny pack ,3
All right you know there 's bumble bee patterns ,3
I mean it 's like do n't worry about it television at least you know everybody 's ,3
I know Florida has it ,3
And it was it was leaking inside the car ,3
and I think that anybody that works in the in some kind of service or for the community or something ,3
Well they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday ,3
that negotiations could n't resolve ,3
you know and this was only well I guess it has been awhile it 's been almost ten years since I moved here ,3
And we have the things that are extras But it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist ,3
Same here tough topic so ,3
We 're both school teachers ,3
And you know they want privacy fences ,3
About how many calls have you made on this system ? ,3
before I went to work and stuff and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I ,3
right and and it 's not the sharing of ,3
and friends that I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with ,3
You know there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you ca n't even get that from a kid you know ,3
Well you can get you can get pressurized lumber ,3
And I would never do it I I love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me ,3
You know when I sat there I you know I dropped my car off for tires or something like that ,3
and that is he 's a little ,3
And they do take up a big part of my my evening and weekend ,3
Right E- even if it is you know a company policy of immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them ,3
Deep one you have a deep one ,3
And I was appalled at what how they were paying them I just could n't believe it ,3
this was when the Peace Corps first are started ,3
Never I 've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors ,3
And so that would probably just tear me apart ,3
I do n't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it ,3
The money 's not available ,3
levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children ,3
it 's kind of hard to to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent ,3
because they 've always gone with us ,3
So that they have at least one service every Sunday ,3
this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house His house is more like a farm house It 's not on a main road ,3
And I 'm doing my best ,3
But there 's not very many people that actually do get killed ,3
very very much there you know ,3
way I guess most of the the ,3
So what do you think ? ,3
take them through the whole chain ,3
I was up in Arequipa ,3
I would say go ahead and execute that person as well ,3
I always like the musicals and ,3
and he said that people in the west he said since being there and I guess he 's been there about six months ,3
and you just end up doing it but if you have n't been married that long you know ,3
Oh I see so if you have fresh dirt they 'll ,3
I do n't know I just think somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than than expecting ,3
to have the same exposure and you know to further their worldliness so to speak ,3
I think it would have been a very good experience for me ,3
Many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors ,3
go hunting or go to the races ,3
Well about a year I guess ,3
I am as a matter of fact I 'm at North Carolina State ,3
And the you know I thought I was making a good wage ,3
Well A- and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know If you can ,3
Did someone just come up with this design and and you 're going to make one for yourself ,3
But we 've I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley Maryland ,3
And then you 're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and ,3
Oh well is it how old is the dog ? ,3
No No and do n't plan on having one either ever ,3
when I take those hoses I cut them off ,3
when they 're decreasing some of the military spending ,3
And I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death ,3
whatever all of those things ,3
they they also have a garden shop and ,3
in her home and they would read and play ,3
You know the higher echelon ,3
So I mean in the sense that we 've come a long way yes but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there ,3
I just pushed that in and I heard it click ,3
I think some of them would rather be in jail ,3
well it will be in a little while I 'm trying to get it get it ready early ,3
You hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the ,3
I wish that when they sentence someone if they 're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years ,3
That 's cold water around there ,3
and I 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language ,3
yes They did have seminars every once in a while ,3
had a hard time getting a few folks I thought well every all these T I -ers have gone home ,3
I had a similar experience I I grew up on a farm so I always had outdoor pets and ,3
Ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one ,3
I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that 's not really the way comedies are right now ,3
That means you 're really sick if you have to use that one ,3
recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato ,3
no but I think that 's that 's it 's that 's taxpayer 's money If somebody ,3
Well I had a little routine that I did for warm ups ,3
she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week ,3
I thi I do n't know how I feel about that I think maybe majority might be sufficient ,3
I know I I did that for summer so I can I can vouch for that ,3
We like Chinese We eat ,3
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait It it ,3
I know what you mean I when I was in Dallas I was supervisor and I had four non exempts under me ,3
With the little thing on the end ,3
Okay well you see it saw it out there then too ,3
No m- most breeders are in it for the money so they 'll bree they 'll breed them twice a year and I ,3
And I would hate it if anyone put me in one ,3
She 's definitely ready to get out and run around ,3
Well we 're really overburdened from federal state and local ,3
Had to learn how to drive a tractor ,3
That 's pretty weird ,3
It it 's I I 've never heard a good story about ,3
But you know I 'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first ,3
I think I was the one who did that actually ,3
I never did My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash and she 'd have squash and corn bread ,3
west out of Colorado Springs ,3
outside at night you know ,3
Now a family I I think that like girls today have children ,3
that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there 's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck ,3
Especially around bonus time ,3
and some some of them did quit the company ,3
because he 's not as good as another kid his same age I mean it 's like you know that 's ridiculous ,3
I pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs ,3
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade ,3
Hey thanks a lot I 'll talk to you later ,3
I watched a lot of T V when the war was on ,3
Been on a real barbecue kick lately ,3
And I do n't know why that is I think it 's probably due to pricing often ,3
We 're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure ,3
Right nobody does then ,3
Well I still think people have a choice You know if you can live with it and it 's you know your conscience is clear ,3
I guess the the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts ,3
my wife is agnostic and I 'm a backsliding Presbyterian ,3
as best I could at home ,3
She pu- she wheeled it out on a cart ,3
I worked my way into having the same engine I do n't know how long I 'm ,3
Well now wait a minute the- there ,3
I would n't like anything of that nature you know ,3
But anyway that was a French movie ,3
Maybe so Let 's see what else can we do ? Changes ,3
Well it 's not the it 's not the best system but it 's the best one in the world ,3
you know And take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs ,3
and should we be involved and what 's it going to cost us in the long run ,3
It 's kind of been scary ,3
and came in and remodeled the whole place ,3
a boy and a girl Last year the the boy twin started doing real well ,3
And the minute I mean the minute something happens ,3
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent ,3
And the tax was administered by the rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when ,3
sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so I 'm actually managing to do this with zero debt ,3
Well now I have the same dental you have ,3
it 's a very broad issue ,3
And if you 've been in for twelve years I 'm sure you 've ,3
you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes ? Or just ,3
Well I enjoyed the topic I hope you have a good day ,3
Oh really because of like the cross-pollination or ,3
And maybe some she 'd have chicken or something ,3
Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES ,3
this is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all our little gift book goes up to but I do n't really know ,3
So that 's that 's a little rough you know we 're not we 're not quite up to that sort of thing ,3
Oh I 'd love to have one but you know ,3
And different circumstances call for different things ,3
It very definitely is ,3
Because if you sp- you know pull on that and I 've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it ,3
Well if they do they do n't know it you know ,3
our government is full of liars thieves and crooks ,3
Gee I know is n't that terrible ,3
And that she has kittens that look like her ,3
not my degree which is I think kind of bizarre ,3
and well I saw what the red in the flag represents ,3
I do n't know do we get a signal ,3
and I really you know they do n't understand how other people live they do n't understand ,3
What kind of cats are they ? ,3
No no state income tax ,3
he 's taken off for parts unknown ,3
but there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and ,3
so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last I guess about the last ten years ,3
Well you were in Peru ? ,3
all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies There is no need to have children if you do n't want them ,3
That 's exactly what they were trying to get them to do ,3
Definitely more to look at ,3
But at least because I back up to a hillside where the wild animals are I think I can probably justify it ,3
pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when lately like the last week or two I guess with Easter ,3
So what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand ,3
See see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college ,3
I think well in your words ,3
And I just do n't like that ,3
with high prices and seven courses is n't what I usually look for ,3
Well I 'd encourage it ,3
Well they say I think I have read recently that the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps ,3
in fact I found that I 'm a lot closer with I have one son who 's gone and I do n't even know where he 's at ,3
and everything else I have some friends who work up there ,3
and that to me is worth the extra money ,3
Oh I agree with that ,3
Oh it 's probably what the first guy who did it called it ,3
Wha- what are you taking in school ,3
and despite our beliefs she was one of the more Charismatic Christian faiths ,3
people you know grow from a small town to a large town ,3
And so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade ,3
and the the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia ,3
Well it it all paid off ,3
Peru but but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than ,3
Well in Florida seems like two or three times a year It 's constantly on the ,3
but they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy and we grow a lot of food ,3
And you 're hoping there is something that will cut down on that ,3
Right We eat out quite a bit it 's just my husband and I at home now So ,3
I did n't ask you that What are you taking in school ? ,3
It it 's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day ,3
I think so too But you know it 's one of those things ,3
Oh this is ter you should n't be talking about this right before while you 're fixing dinner ,3
do n't MUMBLEx I mean I I always MUMBLEx ,3
about the seventh eighth grade I I I started to to come around and realize an and basically I got interested in math ,3
And he started trying to cast it So he he was kind of getting there but he 's ,3
Okay well nice to talk to you ,3
Well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee ,3
It 's the sad life I think today ,3
As you whip it over your head ,3
in front of the treadmills ,3
What do you think about pensions ? Anything on that or ,3
guess that 's I thin that 's my opinion I guess you feel differently ,3
Oh God that would be the exact opposite of here ,3
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keeping trying to keep them away from the T V I guess And McDonald 's ,3
Mom and Dad are a curse ,3
maybe I 'll tell you go something you did n't know about in benefits ,3
okay with nothing missing ,3
it in a million years to do it myself I I I think you ,3
to think about it and ,3
Was she was her show big when you where in school since you have n't been out that long ? ,3
And I do n't know if you get that kind of greeting or not ,3
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours ,3
Well Do you work for T I ? ,3
You know she had there are certain ,3
Like fishing and ... ,3
The same patterns of behavior you mean ? ,3
looking at gray walls You know ,3
which is on sort of a run I have a a thirty foot cable ,3
But like you said I 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there ,3
I think that would be kind of interesting ,3
And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time ,3
I 've never heard of such a thing ,3
It 's just a matter of people not being lazy ,3
of being able to display your your ,3
And I I feel like if they do n't people do n't like what our flag stands for they 're welcome to go some place else ,3
Are are you part of the school system out there ? ,3
I was pretty impressed with Western Auto but they did n't do a great job of changing my transmission oil last time And when ,3
Go right to personnel They got the forms in personnel and maybe ,3
and just makes them just a little more active Television ,3
You probably have some friends that have television ? ,3
because they say we do n't have the money to do it and ,3
and things going on you know I would love to help somebody you know ,3
What line of work are you in now since you went to school and ,3
it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know ,3
It 's true it really is ,3
But Jenny is a sweet kid ,3
we may see more slapstick ,3
this thing they they gave the guys the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it You know ,3
it 's just that I did n't I hate having to be in charge of someone else 's life ,3
That 's the kind I like ,3
And she 's not she 's not feeling too great today ,3
Well Jean we seem to be of the same opinions here ,3
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it ,3
I mean I do n't miss it that much ,3
I shall look into it ,3
you know they have those T V -s right ,3
No nor- normally they just come in and they say you 've overextended your your conversation ,3
if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day ,3
and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself ,3
Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless This may seem to be the best way out I do n't know ,3
And then I like watching a lot of like college basketball and ,3
When people said he was at work ? ,3
Well that could be I could see where that would be important ,3
You do n't they do n't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but ,3
What else I 'm sure we 're getting close to our five minutes whatever here ,3
So we had to have that 's that 's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it ,3
one way or the other ,3
it permits the criminal to get a retrial ,3
so it just happens they built a shopping center next to it ,3
Oh that one I have n't heard about ,3
but once you get that job with the university you 've got ten years of probation ,3
and tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it 's the same thing you know ,3
I think that 's true ,3
More than someone handing something to you ,3
I I I do it a lot I have I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid ,3
that 's true that 's true ,3
just like constantly it seemed like ,3
would vote pro choice ,3
There 's nobody holding them here ,3
let alone other countries ,3
on his own people And I guess that makes sense what you said that within their own borders they feel freer to do ,3
No no I believe they did because some of some of the the Peace Corps that I knew of did marry Peruvians ,3
I 've never heard of it ,3
that would be all the more reason that they 'd take advantage of you ,3
And I do n't know I attributed I think a lot of that to women working ,3
I think in the next session they they modified it but it 's still legal to own or possess weapons in Florida ,3
It did n't it did n't quite pass ,3
Okay Well basically I like comedy shows ,3
or the kids are at home in the morning and ... ,3
and make sure it 's it 's a friendly animal ,3
No that 's true Course they have a requirement that that every single appeal must be permitted ,3
Although I claim Florida as my home now I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere ,3
Yes I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico ,3
and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job ,3
That 's probably true It I was n't hungry it was n't a meal We just he went down and bought some at a ,3
I I g- and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and ,3
Are they good to eat ? ,3
What I miss up here is I 'm originally a Texan and I miss home cooked Mexican ,3
It there 's all kinds ,3
and it it 's funny it 's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children ,3
And I just do n't know sir but it seems like they trying to get you every which way ,3
but if they just get more unto themselves kind of ,3
Hired new nurses and just really just redid it you know ,3
You know it 's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong ,3
Sure it 's it 's a big responsibility it really is ,3
So you do eat out a lot ,3
Do you think most states have that or ? ,3
