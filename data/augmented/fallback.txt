believe me I know there is I lived in Plano and I do n't know if you 're familiar with Plano 
right here in Maryland 
unless they 're just absolutely forced to 
Oh oh absolutely it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money 
and their inability to understand multicultural or multiracial situation 
Well there 's real Mexican food and there 's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans 
That was so cool and then man she 's really porked out again I guess but 
and it worked out wonderfully 
Industrial Marketing 
and they do it again you know 
and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she should n't go because she was alone 
It 's okay for us to go extend our youth 's lives like so much water in the desert 
It 's I do n't see how anyone can afford it 
because it you go to different countries and you see in fact I saw an interview on T V the other night with Patrick Swayze 
but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just can not communicate 
I mean no one has said for sure you know 
well that 's interesting too Well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo 
What what do you call the dog ? 
So honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it 
No it 's just the like the bees and insects will do it 
Oh okay the first person I 've talked to outside of Texas 
a parent and that kind of thing because 
Good luck on that one then 
and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior 
And I 've had my cholesterol checked and a few times and I 've never been above like you know one-hundred and fifty 
and watch the cats tear it up 
You have to what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself 
It 's like a slap on the fingers for them 
That 's right Not enough people want to do that to 
I 've been sitting here alternately reading and watching television 
So you can learn a lot that way I there 's no way I could I could fix every car in the world you know 
Rub up against the siding 
although you still hear about those occasionally 
but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone 
That there are ways to prevent families you know like basically there 's contraceptives and 
instruct- professors from other 
Oh it it was it was tremend- well it was about seven hours labor 
It makes you more at ease You know you knew you were n't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous 
I said good luck on that one then 
She 's the most intelligent dog I 've ever seen Course I 'm a little prejudiced of course 
and I must say it was interesting 
So what kind of neat hobbies do you have ? 
That 's why I lucked out my Dad worked for Braniff when I was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got ... 
And they can stand on their heads if they want too 
That 's where I 've seen it because I 've seen it off and on probably 
so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn ? 
I 've heard it 's pretty cool 
I should know something about T V shows 
Somebody take care of me 
Be- because we 're so we love our freedom 
I mean I guess it 'd go with my flowers 
You have the seven day waiting period 
but you know I look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand 
that you think this is n't sinking in 
That sounds real good 
Well you know if if they have time enough they can 
My house is on a main road and it has nothing 
Because I mean you as an individual what you do that to me is your business 
Well girls at that age 
I said you probably have some friends that have television 
Once upon a time I was Well I have two dogs those are my kids 
I mean things the way we grow are carrots cabbage that sort of MUMBLEx goes to waste 
There 's there 's a lot of you know last minute things that happen cause a person not to 
But I 've received quite a few 
and I mean once the child 's in school if you had a job from say nine to three 
But you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and 
That 's great But it 's kids that come home and do n't have a mother there 
you know all the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that 
That 's a plus Oh I have a total of five children I have three left living at home 
Well it the the the First Amendment definitely says freedom of speech 
Okay you know like how these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other 
Right I do n't care to go to a place just for the price of it 
I agree with you I a group that I 'm a part of goes once a month to a they call it the Heritage House 
Easiest way out maybe No I do n't think it 's a monetary thing 
That would be really awful 
do they have such a thing now as a six man jury ? 
Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up 
It is what you look for ? 
by and large no But but they 're big fun 
right So let 's put up with it I guess 
the feeling that it MUMBLEx with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know 
I like that situation that 's usually real good 
I do n't know Unless I knew that they were somewhere just really I mean just really great 
camping out and eating out 
My God I ca n't imagine 
We were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju- It was just before July fourth 
franchised restaurants I I I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run 
So you know I got my degree and got the better paying job and 
So how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all 
I I spent a couple years down in Plano Texas 
I wa used to watch OPRAH a lot in the afternoons 
there 's excuse me there 's bumble patterns there 's mosquito patterns there 's wasp patterns there 's grub patterns 
that that was memorable somehow I do n't know what it was 
a lot more common sense 
Whenever you have a something that looks like something else 
And although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but 
I mean back then and the show did you see the show where she lost all of that fat ? 
do more you know be more community oriented and all 
involving a violent crime or anything 
and I have seen a town change from a town to a city and its 
And I just would prefer that I mean sometimes we 've said let 's keep we 're not interested in what other countries do 
They can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can 
I 've got about twelve tickets in the mail Do you have you 've MUMBLEx a few ? 
and our freedom of choice 
So I guess from what I understand the thing could just 
and we did n't have all that fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop and 
and go you are just fantastic 
I like the pro actually I like pro basket ball as opposed to MUMBLEx I watch pro football but I like the N B A play-offs 
Oh my gosh I 've got to go to Maine then 
I just do it all Do I there 's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that I 'll do I 
vehemently but it has quieted down but I do n't think they probably feel any differently 
my husband is an only child too and he did miss it that 's kind of why we got back after eighteen months 
Tha- that 's the way they did it in Alabama too 
and they have to shake it off 
and having people But you know our like in our church it it is your free to do that or not 
because you look at their job description you 'd s- you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and 
kind of a waste of a person 
No Because inside the jail there I do n't think there 's no real rehabilitation 
Oh I 'm from Midland 
than these kids that do n't have that responsibility 
Did you take kids along ? 
There is a difference 
You 're working then ? 
And you know although I would n't want it MUMBLEx to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but 
then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal ? 
we 've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman so we usually see like first-rate movies 
there you go and then 
Oh that 's really weird 
You would n't believe it we even raised chickens 
you 're encouraged to do it because you know it it helps you and of course we think it 's helping other people 
And ready to storm into Saudi Should n't we try and help our friends ? 
that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and I the the the whole aspect 
and and both of them 
you 're doing other things 
back when like the Pistons were in them and now where are you calling from ? 
And then I did some very mild say light weight lifting Nothing I 'm not trying to make big bulging muscles 
and it 's a fly you call it a pattern 
I I think that the mother and the child lose and I think that 's why there is so many problems 
they would understand how other people live and 
is that the crime and it 's already MUMBLEx some chart and determine the punishment or 
know but I I still what the stan- flag stands for I guess to me is 
Lots and lots of catnip so it 's it 's still green and it 's been two days so I 'm encouraged 
and it 's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point 
really I 'm kind of open on food I 'm what you might call a culinary adventurer I 'll 
That 's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and 
and you would think you know being an American or whatever 
I think it will be freedom of choice 
and they 're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now 
And that 's going to it 's going to be really good 
It 's just I do n't I do n't know I just 
Oh that 's nice mostly catfish or 
Unfortunately that 's what happens 
so to see if it 's a female they say well do you carry a purse and Pat says no I carry a fanny pack 
All right you know there 's bumble bee patterns 
I mean it 's like do n't worry about it television at least you know everybody 's 
I know Florida has it 
And it was it was leaking inside the car 
and I think that anybody that works in the in some kind of service or for the community or something 
Well they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday 
that negotiations could n't resolve 
you know and this was only well I guess it has been awhile it 's been almost ten years since I moved here 
And we have the things that are extras But it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist 
Same here tough topic so 
We 're both school teachers 
And you know they want privacy fences 
About how many calls have you made on this system ? 
before I went to work and stuff and I see her every once in awhile like if I go workout at T I 
right and and it 's not the sharing of 
and friends that I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with 
You know there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you ca n't even get that from a kid you know 
Well you can get you can get pressurized lumber 
And I would never do it I I love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me 
You know when I sat there I you know I dropped my car off for tires or something like that 
and that is he 's a little 
And they do take up a big part of my my evening and weekend 
Right E- even if it is you know a company policy of immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them 
Deep one you have a deep one 
And I was appalled at what how they were paying them I just could n't believe it 
this was when the Peace Corps first are started 
Never I 've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors 
And so that would probably just tear me apart 
I do n't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it 
The money 's not available 
levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children 
it 's kind of hard to to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent 
because they 've always gone with us 
So that they have at least one service every Sunday 
this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house His house is more like a farm house It 's not on a main road 
And I 'm doing my best 
But there 's not very many people that actually do get killed 
very very much there you know 
way I guess most of the the 
So what do you think ? 
take them through the whole chain 
I was up in Arequipa 
I would say go ahead and execute that person as well 
I always like the musicals and 
and he said that people in the west he said since being there and I guess he 's been there about six months 
and you just end up doing it but if you have n't been married that long you know 
Oh I see so if you have fresh dirt they 'll 
I do n't know I just think somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than than expecting 
to have the same exposure and you know to further their worldliness so to speak 
I think it would have been a very good experience for me 
Many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors 
go hunting or go to the races 
Well about a year I guess 
I am as a matter of fact I 'm at North Carolina State 
And the you know I thought I was making a good wage 
Well A- and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know If you can 
Did someone just come up with this design and and you 're going to make one for yourself 
But we 've I work at the T I site in Hunt Valley Maryland 
And then you 're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and 
Oh well is it how old is the dog ? 
No No and do n't plan on having one either ever 
when I take those hoses I cut them off 
when they 're decreasing some of the military spending 
And I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death 
whatever all of those things 
they they also have a garden shop and 
in her home and they would read and play 
You know the higher echelon 
So I mean in the sense that we 've come a long way yes but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there 
I just pushed that in and I heard it click 
I think some of them would rather be in jail 
well it will be in a little while I 'm trying to get it get it ready early 
You hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the 
I wish that when they sentence someone if they 're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years 
That 's cold water around there 
and I 'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language 
yes They did have seminars every once in a while 
had a hard time getting a few folks I thought well every all these T I -ers have gone home 
I had a similar experience I I grew up on a farm so I always had outdoor pets and 
Ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one 
I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that 's not really the way comedies are right now 
That means you 're really sick if you have to use that one 
recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato 
no but I think that 's that 's it 's that 's taxpayer 's money If somebody 
Well I had a little routine that I did for warm ups 
she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week 
I thi I do n't know how I feel about that I think maybe majority might be sufficient 
I know I I did that for summer so I can I can vouch for that 
We like Chinese We eat 
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait It it 
I know what you mean I when I was in Dallas I was supervisor and I had four non exempts under me 
With the little thing on the end 
Okay well you see it saw it out there then too 
No m- most breeders are in it for the money so they 'll bree they 'll breed them twice a year and I 
And I would hate it if anyone put me in one 
She 's definitely ready to get out and run around 
Well we 're really overburdened from federal state and local 
Had to learn how to drive a tractor 
That 's pretty weird 
It it 's I I 've never heard a good story about 
But you know I 'd like to make sure that I have a job tomorrow first 
I think I was the one who did that actually 
I never did My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash and she 'd have squash and corn bread 
west out of Colorado Springs 
outside at night you know 
Now a family I I think that like girls today have children 
that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there 's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck 
Especially around bonus time 
and some some of them did quit the company 
because he 's not as good as another kid his same age I mean it 's like you know that 's ridiculous 
I pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs 
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade 
Hey thanks a lot I 'll talk to you later 
I watched a lot of T V when the war was on 
Been on a real barbecue kick lately 
And I do n't know why that is I think it 's probably due to pricing often 
We 're lucky to get paychecks the way I figure 
Right nobody does then 
Well I still think people have a choice You know if you can live with it and it 's you know your conscience is clear 
I guess the the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts 
my wife is agnostic and I 'm a backsliding Presbyterian 
as best I could at home 
She pu- she wheeled it out on a cart 
I worked my way into having the same engine I do n't know how long I 'm 
Well now wait a minute the- there 
I would n't like anything of that nature you know 
But anyway that was a French movie 
Maybe so Let 's see what else can we do ? Changes 
Well it 's not the it 's not the best system but it 's the best one in the world 
you know And take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs 
and should we be involved and what 's it going to cost us in the long run 
It 's kind of been scary 
and came in and remodeled the whole place 
a boy and a girl Last year the the boy twin started doing real well 
And the minute I mean the minute something happens 
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent 
And the tax was administered by the rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when 
sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so I 'm actually managing to do this with zero debt 
Well now I have the same dental you have 
it 's a very broad issue 
And if you 've been in for twelve years I 'm sure you 've 
you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes ? Or just 
Well I enjoyed the topic I hope you have a good day 
Oh really because of like the cross-pollination or 
And maybe some she 'd have chicken or something 
Hence is possible error as you can see in all the IRONSIDES 
this is getting close to twenty here which is I think is about all our little gift book goes up to but I do n't really know 
So that 's that 's a little rough you know we 're not we 're not quite up to that sort of thing 
Oh I 'd love to have one but you know 
And different circumstances call for different things 
It very definitely is 
Because if you sp- you know pull on that and I 've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it 
Well if they do they do n't know it you know 
our government is full of liars thieves and crooks 
Gee I know is n't that terrible 
And that she has kittens that look like her 
not my degree which is I think kind of bizarre 
and well I saw what the red in the flag represents 
I do n't know do we get a signal 
and I really you know they do n't understand how other people live they do n't understand 
What kind of cats are they ? 
No no state income tax 
he 's taken off for parts unknown 
but there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and 
so I mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last I guess about the last ten years 
Well you were in Peru ? 
all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies There is no need to have children if you do n't want them 
That 's exactly what they were trying to get them to do 
Definitely more to look at 
But at least because I back up to a hillside where the wild animals are I think I can probably justify it 
pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when lately like the last week or two I guess with Easter 
So what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand 
See see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college 
I think well in your words 
And I just do n't like that 
with high prices and seven courses is n't what I usually look for 
Well I 'd encourage it 
Well they say I think I have read recently that the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps 
in fact I found that I 'm a lot closer with I have one son who 's gone and I do n't even know where he 's at 
and everything else I have some friends who work up there 
and that to me is worth the extra money 
Oh I agree with that 
Oh it 's probably what the first guy who did it called it 
Wha- what are you taking in school 
and despite our beliefs she was one of the more Charismatic Christian faiths 
people you know grow from a small town to a large town 
And so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade 
and the the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia 
Well it it all paid off 
Peru but but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than 
Well in Florida seems like two or three times a year It 's constantly on the 
but they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy and we grow a lot of food 
And you 're hoping there is something that will cut down on that 
Right We eat out quite a bit it 's just my husband and I at home now So 
I did n't ask you that What are you taking in school ? 
It it 's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day 
I think so too But you know it 's one of those things 
Oh this is ter you should n't be talking about this right before while you 're fixing dinner 
do n't MUMBLEx I mean I I always MUMBLEx 
about the seventh eighth grade I I I started to to come around and realize an and basically I got interested in math 
And he started trying to cast it So he he was kind of getting there but he 's 
Okay well nice to talk to you 
Well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee 
It 's the sad life I think today 
As you whip it over your head 
in front of the treadmills 
What do you think about pensions ? Anything on that or 
guess that 's I thin that 's my opinion I guess you feel differently 
Oh God that would be the exact opposite of here 
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keeping trying to keep them away from the T V I guess And McDonald 's 
Mom and Dad are a curse 
maybe I 'll tell you go something you did n't know about in benefits 
okay with nothing missing 
it in a million years to do it myself I I I think you 
to think about it and 
Was she was her show big when you where in school since you have n't been out that long ? 
And I do n't know if you get that kind of greeting or not 
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours 
Well Do you work for T I ? 
You know she had there are certain 
Like fishing and ... 
The same patterns of behavior you mean ? 
looking at gray walls You know 
which is on sort of a run I have a a thirty foot cable 
But like you said I 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there 
I think that would be kind of interesting 
And they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time 
I 've never heard of such a thing 
It 's just a matter of people not being lazy 
of being able to display your your 
And I I feel like if they do n't people do n't like what our flag stands for they 're welcome to go some place else 
Are are you part of the school system out there ? 
I was pretty impressed with Western Auto but they did n't do a great job of changing my transmission oil last time And when 
Go right to personnel They got the forms in personnel and maybe 
and just makes them just a little more active Television 
You probably have some friends that have television ? 
because they say we do n't have the money to do it and 
and things going on you know I would love to help somebody you know 
What line of work are you in now since you went to school and 
it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know 
It 's true it really is 
But Jenny is a sweet kid 
we may see more slapstick 
this thing they they gave the guys the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it You know 
it 's just that I did n't I hate having to be in charge of someone else 's life 
That 's the kind I like 
And she 's not she 's not feeling too great today 
Well Jean we seem to be of the same opinions here 
He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it 
I mean I do n't miss it that much 
I shall look into it 
you know they have those T V -s right 
No nor- normally they just come in and they say you 've overextended your your conversation 
if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day 
and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself 
Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless This may seem to be the best way out I do n't know 
And then I like watching a lot of like college basketball and 
When people said he was at work ? 
Well that could be I could see where that would be important 
You do n't they do n't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but 
What else I 'm sure we 're getting close to our five minutes whatever here 
So we had to have that 's that 's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it 
one way or the other 
it permits the criminal to get a retrial 
so it just happens they built a shopping center next to it 
Oh that one I have n't heard about 
but once you get that job with the university you 've got ten years of probation 
and tell me something that they did and then the next time I go it 's the same thing you know 
I think that 's true 
More than someone handing something to you 
I I I do it a lot I have I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid 
that 's true that 's true 
just like constantly it seemed like 
would vote pro choice 
There 's nobody holding them here 
let alone other countries 
on his own people And I guess that makes sense what you said that within their own borders they feel freer to do 
No no I believe they did because some of some of the the Peace Corps that I knew of did marry Peruvians 
I 've never heard of it 
that would be all the more reason that they 'd take advantage of you 
And I do n't know I attributed I think a lot of that to women working 
I think in the next session they they modified it but it 's still legal to own or possess weapons in Florida 
It did n't it did n't quite pass 
Okay Well basically I like comedy shows 
or the kids are at home in the morning and ... 
and make sure it 's it 's a friendly animal 
No that 's true Course they have a requirement that that every single appeal must be permitted 
Although I claim Florida as my home now I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere 
Yes I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico 
and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job 
That 's probably true It I was n't hungry it was n't a meal We just he went down and bought some at a 
I I g- and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and 
Are they good to eat ? 
What I miss up here is I 'm originally a Texan and I miss home cooked Mexican 
It there 's all kinds 
and it it 's funny it 's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children 
And I just do n't know sir but it seems like they trying to get you every which way 
but if they just get more unto themselves kind of 
Hired new nurses and just really just redid it you know 
You know it 's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong 
Sure it 's it 's a big responsibility it really is 
So you do eat out a lot 
Do you think most states have that or ? 
he said that his whole idea of what 's important has changed 
Anyway time we spend with our children 
And it 's amazing that you know prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks 
okay this is a foreign country 
Oh well he made it at fifty 
That 's right Absolutely 
And I I did a lot of growing up there 
by s- b- freedom of speech 
because that would just I would feel so guilty 
Rent a car when you get there and all that 
We had a Black man was accused simply because he resembled 
Oh Well he 's a bad person very definitely 
Oh you mean size wise they 're not very big ? 
Well I I was going to ask too does your wife work ? 
And entirely too much time is spent my wife and I were wondering what if 
just trying to try and stay as firm as I can stay in my old age 
I hope they get something out of this 
That 's right you should be careful That 's pretty funny 
I mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it 
Did you go with kids though ? 
Right I 'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for there 's a guy at this particular one I go to 
But that 's great I did n't know there were such groups 
I do n't know little girls are n't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were 
that 's true that 's very true That 's and that 's the 
but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things I mean 
I 've got a a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian 
no I was n't I did n't was n't aware of that no 
And he could have disap- gotten away at lunch time 
Well and amazingly a lot of times it 's real easy 
they can see you know You do n't see what you do n't you ca n't know what you do n't see

I 'm sure it does So you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home ? 
That 's great I always thought it 'd be great to have twins 
Oh that 's right I think now that I recall reading about it in the paper
