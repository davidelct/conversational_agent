but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things I mean ,4
U- usually you 'd see these big chain gangs out there picking up trash ,4
And that does make a big difference ,4
I see what you 're saying there 's less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag ,4
But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids I have a three year old and a six year old ,4
I do n't I do n't well becau- because they 're the ones who make the laws ,4

It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system ,4
and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma ,4

you know and this was only well I guess it has been awhile it 's been almost ten years since I moved here ,4

some part of whatever they 're accused of ,4
they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them ,4
exercise area is covered in boxes ,4
I know I guess with that money who cares ,4
And well that just rancles me no I swear if I ever saw somebody to burning a flag I 'd I 'd try to kill them I would ,4
Fact you may be able to take care take advantage of that It 's through Baxter Labs ,4
I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that cooking that 's not really a hobby it 's a necessity ,4
I think it should be permitted under certain circus- ,4
Well I do n't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there I could n't even hear what you were saying but ,4
It gets boring after a while but I do n't go ahead ,4
There 's no official document signed or anything ? ,4
And I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death ,4
It might have a new name ,4
and they were n't dropping dead of heart attacks ,4
Well and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It 's ,4
and want to develop that ,4
of these things and then perhaps perhaps it 's unfair because I I I must admit I enjoy these movies ,4
And you whip the line ,4
I think it would have been a very good experience for me ,4
and I usually come away thinking no I really do n't like this show ,4
go hunting or go to the races ,4
with high prices and seven courses is n't what I usually look for ,4
Make a recommendation ? ,4
using it But yet the ,4
And they say well they 're trying to deduce what he or she is ,4
school taxes and property taxes ,4
And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off ,4
stay over there because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay ,4
you know or different opinions ,4
Maybe you still can do that Do you do you buy your pills one at a time ? ,4
I was more intelligent than the position I was holding ,4
Had to learn how to drive a tractor ,4
I have high blood pressure problems myself ,4
You know what I 'm saying ? Like ,4
Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un- unemployment rate ,4
I think it 'd be a lot better ,4
You know what my absolutely favorite show is ? ,4
It 's pretty cool I like that whenever I watch it ,4
So that they have at least one service every Sunday ,4
Lots and lots of catnip so it 's it 's still green and it 's been two days so I 'm encouraged ,4
Well I grew up in Los Angeles ,4
And so I 've prior to that I I worked in a food store ,4
Anyway time we spend with our children ,4
and I 'm trying to think about the only other show I watch ,4
That was so cool and then man she 's really porked out again I guess but ,4
So she gets destroyed on her bonus check ,4
course that was not restricted just to just us ,4
Everyone would appeal ,4
That will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday ,4
Well no no You fish upstream ,4
and you just end up doing it but if you have n't been married that long you know ,4
once a week twice a week ? ,4
I 've I 'm kind of stuck on them right now I guess But you know that 's it 's partially because I can work on them That 's ,4
My God I ca n't imagine ,4
Well I 'm from Indiana ,4
Bring some of these things out ,4
about two thirds of an acre So we each have a third of an acre we do ,4
It it it 's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning ,4
Got to go take care of the children ,4
Lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that 's up there ,4
Mexican restaurants where it 's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation ,4
Well course I went through this what about five years ago They may have improved it considerably ,4
in case they did n't put the oil in or whatever ,4
Of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence ,4
by and large no But but they 're big fun ,4
so we 'll get to see her a little more than what we do the other ones ,4
You know for just for just a day not in- you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that ,4
Actually it 's Gin two ,4
And it 's not their job to fight for their own land ,4
They do n't it just looks so much better when it 's up against the house tiered up ,4
fishing is fun up here It 's not ,4
But the rest of our friends we go and watch them ,4
Right And and that 's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so ,4
Right and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff ,4
because you look at their job description you 'd s- you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and ,4
She has the the color and the black to- tongue of a Chow but she has the shap- the shape of the Shepherd ,4
and the people love them ,4
That 's exactly what they were trying to get them to do ,4
currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and ,4
So you 're fishing downstream so it will carry some ? ,4
But she 's big enough to be intimidating ,4
doors open you just run ,4
So I do n't think that they deserve anything less ,4
Now now we are a a legitimate player ,4
That 's the girls I lived with and you know other then that I 'm sure they watched ,4
We 're not Americans we 're North Americans and they 're South Americans ,4
and I remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage I said boy would n't I give to get be back in school ,4
That 's something that if I had to work in an elderly home I do n't think I could do it ,4
I I always said that if I had a kid they would n't know what McDonald 's is ,4
that did n't go to college and they do the same old things they did in high school and ,4
I mean you know like I say I 'm in New York and we have a state tax as well So that just cuts even more ,4
they 'll knock each others blocks off ,4
that 's a typical that 's a typical one that 's in there The forms are right in personnel ,4
it it depends on the person ,4
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keeping trying to keep them away from the T V I guess And McDonald 's ,4
you know it just you know I saw the family falling apart down ,4
I actually eat pretty much anything that I want ,4
president someday maybe ,4
So it it 's interesting ,4
I think that 's true ,4
just because people or so I do n't know just today people are just so money hungry ,4
you 're an instructor you said ,4
actually I 'm a big Chicago Bears ' fan ,4
but I do n't know that it would be state approved ,4
So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce something like that ,4
And and most of them are n't ,4
Right We used to do that once in a while but we do n't anymore ,4
Well now wait a minute the- there ,4
And those people they 're so sweet and ,4
Well they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday ,4
very much so what I 've tried to do now that I 've fi- went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old ,4
You know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need ,4
Well it it all paid off ,4
or the kids are at home in the morning and ... ,4
We 're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis ,4
Polk Institute It 's an old university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded ,4
But you know I I agree with that because I see people that I know f- again from high school ,4
so you have children I take it ? ,4
And I f- you know I know that Texas does n't have a state tax ,4
when you would walk in the smell was just ,4
I did n't ask you that What are you taking in school ? ,4
Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building ? ,4
And it was it was pretty wild ,4
You know you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property ,4
and and both of them ,4
Deep one you have a deep one ,4
Well to me it was dirty for one thing ,4
And that includes everyone at T I ,4
And I have other friends It 's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them ,4
I 've been here three years ,4
It would really and I do n't the people that I 've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that ,4
we 've always got got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door ,4
well sometimes I 'm home and sometimes I 'm not but if I am it 's always fun to talk ,4
well that 's interesting too Well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo ,4
So it 's it 's really kind of crazy ,4
Oh I 've never heard of Polk but ,4
And until then I never paid attention to soap operas ,4
or vote to limit the way it 's spent ,4
But when you 're only at living wage it does n't matter ,4
I think that would be kind of interesting ,4
There 's there 's a lot of you know last minute things that happen cause a person not to ,4
Well they said it w- this this happened during lunch time ,4
and it would start blowing the water out inside ,4
I I I 'm a fly fisherman ,4
But I was called up as an alternate once but I ,4
maybe I 'll tell you go something you did n't know about in benefits ,4
But what I ca n't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth did n't fight would n't fight ,4
And what 's that other one where they where they do the skits well you 've must have seen it recently ? ,4
Well I think I do n't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes ,4
You know to mothers not being at home ,4
Right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do ,4
a parent and that kind of thing because ,4
Oh that ought to give their programming trouble should n't it ? ,4
You know it you know me being one person with a above the median income ,4
It 's kind of been scary ,4
they can see you know You do n't see what you do n't you ca n't know what you do n't see ,4
We 've been doing that too We 're trying to retire in our fifties ,4
the the Brady Bill that 's ,4
Or so it seems I may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive ,4
So I did n't have much of a role model to go by ,4
but we both work and we have a daughter and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway ,4
And but boy there is a there is a bad you know the old brash or ugly American-type ,4
So child care your views ,4
And I figured oh no it will never last but ,4
And the you know I thought I was making a good wage ,4
there must be Texas people as near as I can tell Well ,4
Many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors ,4
And I have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults ,4
It 's like a slap on the fingers for them ,4
Same patterns of behavior ,4
kind of a waste of a person ,4
And I got caught up in a layoff ,4
you recognized this and ,4
Well they this place that we visit it 's really neat They have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in ,4
but I 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual ,4
Lubbock Midland Odessa ,4
Okay medical go ahead I 'm I 'm medical That 's mine ,4
out there and you know how it is The water 's kind of ,4
Well I like gardening a lot I like to be outside ,4
Video games boys and malls ,4
A lot of it has to do from too much T V ,4
more than that 's more than the property I have right here that you 've got as a garden that 's amazing ,4
And they have real short hair It 's curly as a matter of fact ,4
I always like the musicals and ,4
Oh God that would be the exact opposite of here ,4
there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying ,4
Yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else ,4
And a lot of times you ca n't ,4
yes They did have seminars every once in a while ,4
because I mean I really did n't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test ,4
Trading their lives for cigarettes ,4
Okay the medical you have to have a deductible ,4
But she is a great comfort to me ,4
Out of which direction from there ? ,4
It 's mostly you know even if you want to say home you really ca n't ,4
I know what you mean I like some ambiance and I like good food I do n't like fast food hamburgers and all of that ,4
in and around Dallas ,4
Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner ,4
It did n't it did n't quite pass ,4
because they 've always gone with us ,4
And I understand Six Flags is real expensive now ,4
So there 's no incentive for them to do anything Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money ,4
and things going on you know I would love to help somebody you know ,4
Golly ! A couple three hundred dollars ,4
and I 've I could live in an apartment I live in Waco okay ,4
Oh my gosh I 've got to go to Maine then ,4
And transportation expenses I guess you own a car ,4
I 'm I 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess ,4
And although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but ,4
Well but T I is up there so that part of it would probably work out ,4
I I think that the mother and the child lose and I think that 's why there is so many problems ,4
What do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners ? ,4
nice talking with you Are you calling from Texas by the way ? ,4
it 's your account period It does n't matter where you go or anything That 's your account to roll over ,4
How long has it been since you 've had one ? ,4
Get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they they start stiffening the penalties ,4
That 's right they do n't want to take care of the kids ,4
kind of hard to notice that Dad is n't around ,4
Well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was ,4
started working she worked a job until we moved to our new house and she quit that job because it was too inconvenient And ,4
I wo n't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I ,4
Okay you know like how these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other ,4
and to maintain it And to me that 's black eye to every man that ever p- carried a weapon or killed for his country ,4
So I mean in the sense that we 've come a long way yes but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there ,4
And it 's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too ,4
Well frankly I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they 're getting paid ,4
Well I I 've seen more graduates from M I T and that ,4
And I I did a lot of growing up there ,4
but people that I have known that have done that like from other countries especially ,4
And redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more place for them to be ,4
Kuwait was the nonaggressor ,4
You know like it 's really morally wrong to eat meat or something ,4
I guess the the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts ,4
we came back with sweets We did n't bring all the healthy food back too ,4
I think they 're all bad really They 're ,4
And what 's the name of this book again ? ,4
That 's a real good he talks about that Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that ,4
do something about it ,4
I had all my instructors home phone numbers ,4
me ask you this then ,4
something like that I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so I 'm going to wait on those ,4
I have a well a mutt myself I call it a Chowperd ,4
So you work for it T I then You ca n't say ? ,4
Exactly it 's ki- I find it kind of sad I really do ,4
I do n't think that I do n't think that we ,4
But not how they 're going to sentence you ,4
I enjoyed talking about pets with you ,4
and make sure it 's it 's a friendly animal ,4
So how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all ,4
Or whatever whatever the the amount is I do n't want to say three months but ,4
cut money on your taxes ,4
They can go outside and just to know that they 're not you know laying in a room ,4
So it 's a little bit more humane I guess it is ,4
Have a lawyer background Have a law background you 're right ,4
Did they have an outside consultant like a the employ- ,4
She just recently started working then ,4
See see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college ,4
And we have the things that are extras But it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist ,4
Then you have tenure And they ca n't fire you ,4
right here in Maryland ,4
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade ,4
You 're casting the weight of the line ,4
Oh it 's probably what the first guy who did it called it ,4
I 'm trying to learn how to cook deserts without without all of the sweets you know maybe use honey or something ,4
on what does really happen ,4
No No and do n't plan on having one either ever ,4
I spent couple of years down there Moved down there in eighty-seven and moved out in eighty-nine ,4
and I think that there 's too much in the in in a way of self-gratification today ,4
and pro football I mean that sounds kind of stupid but ,4
two players really get go at it ,4
Well what 's your views on it ? ,4
where elderly people are abused and things like that ,4
Not with me personally It is with a lot of other people ,4
And I worked that shift for eleven years ,4
I have to do that I want to make some flower beds and I 'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil ,4
when you 're s- when you 're working so hard and going to school too ,4
Nevertheless you maintain that it 's it is the right of of any citizen ,4
I think it 's two seventy-five for a family but the dental is right away ,4
She 's real sweet And at times she enjoys it at times not ,4
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait It it ,4
Yes so have we been very very fortunate ,4
well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city ,4
they leave they leave some songs with you I do n't know what it is ,4
And got it over with ,4
I 've got about twelve tickets in the mail Do you have you 've MUMBLEx a few ? ,4
I do n't know whether you did yours Not to really pull on those I ,4
It 's just not right ,4
why they expect it 's going to start this week you know ,4
Right I 'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for there 's a guy at this particular one I go to ,4
now our local stores do n't do n't offer any guarantee ,4
If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine ,4
And so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that 's how often they change the ,4
So we were I felt I was losing my family ,4
I do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home ,4
A- an- and that 's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down ,4
for because of a service that they could provide ,4
and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole ,4
have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same I do n't know I guess I get I get all ,4
Well you know if if they have time enough they can ,4
And I do n't know if you get that kind of greeting or not ,4
Which your income would be a lot better ,4
I know what you mean I when I was in Dallas I was supervisor and I had four non exempts under me ,4
Well it 's hard to talk about something it 's like me talking about taxes or something ,4
Right You 're absolutely right That 's a good one ,4
But but I enjoy it I like to think that I 'm a very good cook ,4
So of course the the attorneys ,4
It 's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars ,4
That 's like automobile insurance You never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there ,4
at one o'clock on Friday ,4
long as you have a good time that 's the main point so ,4
Oh for heaven 's sake So there 's nine years of that man 's life gone ,4
I had a I teach a course in Voice I O Systems ,4
We 'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know ,4
But like you said I 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there ,4
Hope hope the stud will find her attractive ,4
Where are you from ? ,4
If you do n't have bars on the window you 're not even safe you know ? ,4
they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out ,4
and things like that and I think that it would help people to become ,4
That 's what I 'm saying you know I think it 's great that women have a choice today ,4
I 've been getting mine ,4
I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the the most intelligent dogs around ,4
and to be more responsible when you 're out on your own trying to ,4
And and the only reason I did it I ,4
And I just do n't like that ,4
Well that was a real farm ,4
we 've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman so we usually see like first-rate movies ,4
and it was you know It was like ki- kind of like the way we feel about going to work ,4
Oh at least once a week We 're we 're retired now When we working out we ate out more than that ,4
Because the kids just brighten up their lives ,4
well my goal is to try to retire by the time I 'm fifty-five ,4
But I do make her come in ,4
and the British and the French ,4
Okay I I have five children all together ,4
What kind of cats are they ? ,4
Hey thanks a lot I 'll talk to you later ,4
Well that sounds like fun ,4
Oh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ,4
It 's hard to say though ,4
everything 's free except for the food ,4
And so then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours ,4
And they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not So they ,4
especially young kids getting out of high school ,4
Oh I would have liked to have a kid with me I think preferably someone seven or eight ,4
Do you well that makes a difference ,4
when that 's done and how do you feel about it ? ,4
That means you 're really sick if you have to use that one ,4
And I do n't know why that is I think it 's probably due to pricing often ,4
I went to college at Tech so You 've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing ,4
to your child 's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it 's ,4
and you said this was your fi- well you 'll you 'll get a couple more probably ,4
they do n't even consider it ,4
Well the only thing up here ,4
We were there the Brits were there ,4
That 's fine that 's that 's the freedom of choice ,4
and that 's all they know ,4
It 's it 's better to be employed ,4
that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were ,4
I really do n't think so ,4
and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used ,4
I think well in your words ,4
that that was memorable somehow I do n't know what it was ,4
Its building contra- or building supplies place ,4
Well you were in Peru ? ,4
