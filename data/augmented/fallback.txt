It 's I heard it 's twenty bucks a whack For adults 
Oh We eat at Shoney 's 
That 's cheaper than we pay 
they they also have a garden shop and 
do more you know be more community oriented and all 
Oh they 're bulbs for Spring or Fall ? 
I mean in a grocery store 
But at least once you pay your way in there 
shrimp straight out of the bay 
apparently It 's very sophisticated And I guess it may be one of the best that anyone 's doing 
she 'd rather sle sleep outside on the the cold ground at night 
in the store you leave your car running 
If you do n't have the the special tools or well any more the the testers that you know 
it 's like golly if kids start imitating that 
And I 'm going to my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter 
You know I had to work but I tried to make it as painless as possible 
I ca n't even hear what you 're 
We ca n't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials 
As we walk through the the lobby they 'll all say bring her here I want to see her I would love to hold her 
I I I do it a lot I have I kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid 
Sharon Pennsylvania 's up there 
for New York state you know I 'm a s I 'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and 
then it 's kind of tough 
Well I have n't you know when the war was on I watched C N N and NIGHTLINE 
they need to take things at their own speed 
And insurance is insurance bad there ? 
and my father works in films and such and I tend to tend to be hypercritical 
Yes it certainly does 
What line of work are you in now since you went to school and 
unless the actual fire hinders somebody 's health and well-being you know but I I think that 's I 
Well what type of restaurant do you like Richard ? 
so it just happens they built a shopping center next to it 
but they seem to fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things I mean 
U- usually you 'd see these big chain gangs out there picking up trash 
And that does make a big difference 
I see what you 're saying there 's less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag 
But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids I have a three year old and a six year old 
I do n't I do n't well becau- because they 're the ones who make the laws 
Is it guilt or innocence But then again so many times you get one or two holdouts and and 
and the good guys can get hit all day long 
Wha- what are you taking in school 
worked about fifty-one hours a week because I worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday 
Well that 's one of those little little extras that you do n't see in the the the the handbook you know 
A lot of like dancers and stuff like that 
Of course I do n't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind 
and I think that anybody that works in the in some kind of service or for the community or something 
It it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money 
And ready to storm into Saudi Should n't we try and help our friends ? 
So you can learn a lot that way I there 's no way I could I could fix every car in the world you know 
Okay well you see it saw it out there then too 
do n't know It 's very it 's it 's you know It 's a it 's a topsy-turvy world and it 's really something how political 
and they have gotten comfortable being around these people 
I I spent a couple years down in Plano Texas 
And prior to their when I when they were in elementary school they were identi identified as being slow 
I tried it but I did n't care for it Not there but at my brothers I tried it 
Well that 's wonderful 
You do n't they do n't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but 
It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system 
and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma 
I guess so We tend to use just bait 
You know there is no harm in that whereas sometimes you ca n't even get that from a kid you know 
He did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours 
Well when you get out into the real world then you 'll know 
they do n't know what poor is 
Oh this is ter you should n't be talking about this right before while you 're fixing dinner 
instruct- professors from other 
has affected you personally You know I do n't know or a person personally 
Time spent with Mom and Dad is next is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them 
It at times gets incredibly hot here 
Oh My husband would like to live there but I do n't know All of our family is here so 
extraordinary things on T V 
I mean she she reads all kinds of books so I wish I knew more to tell you why but 
Oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from 
there 's excuse me there 's bumble patterns there 's mosquito patterns there 's wasp patterns there 's grub patterns 
Well I happen to be a flag freak I served I was in the service 
Sometimes if you 're a tinkerer you luck out My wife 's 
you know and this was only well I guess it has been awhile it 's been almost ten years since I moved here 
You know I mean you 're not totally out of the loop 
And no one can tell anyone anything 
And so I mean something real life I just 
a- if you 're willing to work for it 
WAYNE 'S WORLD hey man 
You ca n't just tell them that anyway but 
It was really bad because of the water 
So he ended up going to Korea and his buddies ended up going to Saudi Well he 's still in Korea and his buddies home now 
Oh another west Texan 
if they are n't prepared for it 
Oh how nice I would love to live up there 
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it 's going off 
some part of whatever they 're accused of 
they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them 
exercise area is covered in boxes 
I know I guess with that money who cares 
And well that just rancles me no I swear if I ever saw somebody to burning a flag I 'd I 'd try to kill them I would 
Fact you may be able to take care take advantage of that It 's through Baxter Labs 
I just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that cooking that 's not really a hobby it 's a necessity 
I think it should be permitted under certain circus- 
Well I do n't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there I could n't even hear what you were saying but 
It gets boring after a while but I do n't go ahead 
There 's no official document signed or anything ? 
And I was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death 
It might have a new name 
and they were n't dropping dead of heart attacks 
Well and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It 's 
and want to develop that 
of these things and then perhaps perhaps it 's unfair because I I I must admit I enjoy these movies 
And you whip the line 
I think it would have been a very good experience for me 
and I usually come away thinking no I really do n't like this show 
go hunting or go to the races 
with high prices and seven courses is n't what I usually look for 
Make a recommendation ? 
using it But yet the 
And they say well they 're trying to deduce what he or she is 
school taxes and property taxes 
And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off 
stay over there because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay 
you know or different opinions 
Maybe you still can do that Do you do you buy your pills one at a time ? 
I was more intelligent than the position I was holding 
Had to learn how to drive a tractor 
I have high blood pressure problems myself 
You know what I 'm saying ? Like 
Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a un- unemployment rate 
I think it 'd be a lot better 
You know what my absolutely favorite show is ? 
It 's pretty cool I like that whenever I watch it 
So that they have at least one service every Sunday 
Lots and lots of catnip so it 's it 's still green and it 's been two days so I 'm encouraged 
Well I grew up in Los Angeles 
And so I 've prior to that I I worked in a food store 
Anyway time we spend with our children 
and I 'm trying to think about the only other show I watch 
That was so cool and then man she 's really porked out again I guess but 
So she gets destroyed on her bonus check 
course that was not restricted just to just us 
Everyone would appeal 
That will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday 
Well no no You fish upstream 
and you just end up doing it but if you have n't been married that long you know 
once a week twice a week ? 
I 've I 'm kind of stuck on them right now I guess But you know that 's it 's partially because I can work on them That 's 
My God I ca n't imagine 
Well I 'm from Indiana 
Bring some of these things out 
about two thirds of an acre So we each have a third of an acre we do 
It it it 's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning 
Got to go take care of the children 
Lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that 's up there 
Mexican restaurants where it 's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation 
Well course I went through this what about five years ago They may have improved it considerably 
in case they did n't put the oil in or whatever 
Of course now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence 
by and large no But but they 're big fun 
so we 'll get to see her a little more than what we do the other ones 
You know for just for just a day not in- you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that 
Actually it 's Gin two 
And it 's not their job to fight for their own land 
They do n't it just looks so much better when it 's up against the house tiered up 
fishing is fun up here It 's not 
But the rest of our friends we go and watch them 
Right And and that 's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so 
Right and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff 
because you look at their job description you 'd s- you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and 
She has the the color and the black to- tongue of a Chow but she has the shap- the shape of the Shepherd 
and the people love them 
That 's exactly what they were trying to get them to do 
currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and 
So you 're fishing downstream so it will carry some ? 
But she 's big enough to be intimidating 
doors open you just run 
So I do n't think that they deserve anything less 
Now now we are a a legitimate player 
That 's the girls I lived with and you know other then that I 'm sure they watched 
We 're not Americans we 're North Americans and they 're South Americans 
and I remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage I said boy would n't I give to get be back in school 
That 's something that if I had to work in an elderly home I do n't think I could do it 
I I always said that if I had a kid they would n't know what McDonald 's is 
that did n't go to college and they do the same old things they did in high school and 
I mean you know like I say I 'm in New York and we have a state tax as well So that just cuts even more 
they 'll knock each others blocks off 
that 's a typical that 's a typical one that 's in there The forms are right in personnel 
it it depends on the person 
Probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keeping trying to keep them away from the T V I guess And McDonald 's 
you know it just you know I saw the family falling apart down 
I actually eat pretty much anything that I want 
president someday maybe 
So it it 's interesting 
I think that 's true 
just because people or so I do n't know just today people are just so money hungry 
you 're an instructor you said 
actually I 'm a big Chicago Bears ' fan 
but I do n't know that it would be state approved 
So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce something like that 
And and most of them are n't 
Right We used to do that once in a while but we do n't anymore 
Well now wait a minute the- there 
And those people they 're so sweet and 
Well they talked to one Kuwaiti woman yesterday 
very much so what I 've tried to do now that I 've fi- went back to school and got my degree when I was thirty years old 
You know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need 
Well it it all paid off 
or the kids are at home in the morning and ... 
We 're supposed to talk about the Middle East Crisis 
Polk Institute It 's an old university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded 
But you know I I agree with that because I see people that I know f- again from high school 
so you have children I take it ? 
And I f- you know I know that Texas does n't have a state tax 
when you would walk in the smell was just 
I did n't ask you that What are you taking in school ? 
Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building ? 
And it was it was pretty wild 
You know you do n't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property 
and and both of them 
Deep one you have a deep one 
Well to me it was dirty for one thing 
And that includes everyone at T I 
And I have other friends It 's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them 
I 've been here three years 
It would really and I do n't the people that I 've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that 
we 've always got got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door 
well sometimes I 'm home and sometimes I 'm not but if I am it 's always fun to talk 
well that 's interesting too Well it sounds as though you are in favor of status quo 
So it 's it 's really kind of crazy 
Oh I 've never heard of Polk but 
And until then I never paid attention to soap operas 
or vote to limit the way it 's spent 
But when you 're only at living wage it does n't matter 
I think that would be kind of interesting 
There 's there 's a lot of you know last minute things that happen cause a person not to 
Well they said it w- this this happened during lunch time 
and it would start blowing the water out inside 
I I I 'm a fly fisherman 
But I was called up as an alternate once but I 
maybe I 'll tell you go something you did n't know about in benefits 
But what I ca n't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth did n't fight would n't fight 
And what 's that other one where they where they do the skits well you 've must have seen it recently ? 
Well I think I do n't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes 
You know to mothers not being at home 
Right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do 
a parent and that kind of thing because 
Oh that ought to give their programming trouble should n't it ? 
You know it you know me being one person with a above the median income 
It 's kind of been scary 
they can see you know You do n't see what you do n't you ca n't know what you do n't see 
We 've been doing that too We 're trying to retire in our fifties 
the the Brady Bill that 's 
Or so it seems I may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive 
So I did n't have much of a role model to go by 
but we both work and we have a daughter and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway 
And but boy there is a there is a bad you know the old brash or ugly American-type 
So child care your views 
And I figured oh no it will never last but 
And the you know I thought I was making a good wage 
there must be Texas people as near as I can tell Well 
Many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors 
And I have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults 
It 's like a slap on the fingers for them 
Same patterns of behavior 
kind of a waste of a person 
And I got caught up in a layoff 
you recognized this and 
Well they this place that we visit it 's really neat They have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in 
but I 'm rather in favor of people being bilingual 
Lubbock Midland Odessa 
Okay medical go ahead I 'm I 'm medical That 's mine 
out there and you know how it is The water 's kind of 
Well I like gardening a lot I like to be outside 
Video games boys and malls 
A lot of it has to do from too much T V 
more than that 's more than the property I have right here that you 've got as a garden that 's amazing 
And they have real short hair It 's curly as a matter of fact 
I always like the musicals and 
Oh God that would be the exact opposite of here 
there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying 
Yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else 
And a lot of times you ca n't 
yes They did have seminars every once in a while 
because I mean I really did n't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test 
Trading their lives for cigarettes 
Okay the medical you have to have a deductible 
But she is a great comfort to me 
Out of which direction from there ? 
It 's mostly you know even if you want to say home you really ca n't 
I know what you mean I like some ambiance and I like good food I do n't like fast food hamburgers and all of that 
in and around Dallas 
Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner 
It did n't it did n't quite pass 
because they 've always gone with us 
And I understand Six Flags is real expensive now 
So there 's no incentive for them to do anything Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money 
and things going on you know I would love to help somebody you know 
Golly ! A couple three hundred dollars 
and I 've I could live in an apartment I live in Waco okay 
Oh my gosh I 've got to go to Maine then 
And transportation expenses I guess you own a car 
I 'm I 'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess 
And although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but 
Well but T I is up there so that part of it would probably work out 
I I think that the mother and the child lose and I think that 's why there is so many problems 
What do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners ? 
nice talking with you Are you calling from Texas by the way ? 
it 's your account period It does n't matter where you go or anything That 's your account to roll over 
How long has it been since you 've had one ? 
Get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they they start stiffening the penalties 
That 's right they do n't want to take care of the kids 
kind of hard to notice that Dad is n't around 
Well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a Ph D in how to get a job after he was 
started working she worked a job until we moved to our new house and she quit that job because it was too inconvenient And 
I wo n't be getting a whole heck of a lot from T I 
Okay you know like how these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other 
and to maintain it And to me that 's black eye to every man that ever p- carried a weapon or killed for his country 
So I mean in the sense that we 've come a long way yes but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there 
And it 's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself too 
Well frankly I think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they 're getting paid 
Well I I 've seen more graduates from M I T and that 
And I I did a lot of growing up there 
but people that I have known that have done that like from other countries especially 
And redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more place for them to be 
Kuwait was the nonaggressor 
You know like it 's really morally wrong to eat meat or something 
I guess the the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts 
we came back with sweets We did n't bring all the healthy food back too 
I think they 're all bad really They 're 
And what 's the name of this book again ? 
That 's a real good he talks about that Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that 
do something about it 
I had all my instructors home phone numbers 
me ask you this then 
something like that I got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so I 'm going to wait on those 
I have a well a mutt myself I call it a Chowperd 
So you work for it T I then You ca n't say ? 
Exactly it 's ki- I find it kind of sad I really do 
I do n't think that I do n't think that we 
But not how they 're going to sentence you 
I enjoyed talking about pets with you 
and make sure it 's it 's a friendly animal 
So how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all 
Or whatever whatever the the amount is I do n't want to say three months but 
cut money on your taxes 
They can go outside and just to know that they 're not you know laying in a room 
So it 's a little bit more humane I guess it is 
Have a lawyer background Have a law background you 're right 
Did they have an outside consultant like a the employ- 
She just recently started working then 
See see now my parents there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college 
And we have the things that are extras But it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist 
Then you have tenure And they ca n't fire you 
right here in Maryland 
some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade 
You 're casting the weight of the line 
Oh it 's probably what the first guy who did it called it 
I 'm trying to learn how to cook deserts without without all of the sweets you know maybe use honey or something 
on what does really happen 
No No and do n't plan on having one either ever 
I spent couple of years down there Moved down there in eighty-seven and moved out in eighty-nine 
and I think that there 's too much in the in in a way of self-gratification today 
and pro football I mean that sounds kind of stupid but 
two players really get go at it 
Well what 's your views on it ? 
where elderly people are abused and things like that 
Not with me personally It is with a lot of other people 
And I worked that shift for eleven years 
I have to do that I want to make some flower beds and I 'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil 
when you 're s- when you 're working so hard and going to school too 
Nevertheless you maintain that it 's it is the right of of any citizen 
I think it 's two seventy-five for a family but the dental is right away 
She 's real sweet And at times she enjoys it at times not 
if she can get yourself out of a bad situation without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait It it 
Yes so have we been very very fortunate 
well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city 
they leave they leave some songs with you I do n't know what it is 
And got it over with 
I 've got about twelve tickets in the mail Do you have you 've MUMBLEx a few ? 
I do n't know whether you did yours Not to really pull on those I 
It 's just not right 
why they expect it 's going to start this week you know 
Right I 'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for there 's a guy at this particular one I go to 
now our local stores do n't do n't offer any guarantee 
If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine 
And so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that 's how often they change the 
So we were I felt I was losing my family 
I do n't know anyone personally that 's in an elderly home 
A- an- and that 's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down 
for because of a service that they could provide 
and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole 
have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same I do n't know I guess I get I get all 
Well you know if if they have time enough they can 
And I do n't know if you get that kind of greeting or not 
Which your income would be a lot better 
I know what you mean I when I was in Dallas I was supervisor and I had four non exempts under me 
Well it 's hard to talk about something it 's like me talking about taxes or something 
Right You 're absolutely right That 's a good one 
But but I enjoy it I like to think that I 'm a very good cook 
So of course the the attorneys 
It 's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars 
That 's like automobile insurance You never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there 
at one o'clock on Friday 
long as you have a good time that 's the main point so 
Oh for heaven 's sake So there 's nine years of that man 's life gone 
I had a I teach a course in Voice I O Systems 
We 'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know 
But like you said I 'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there 
Hope hope the stud will find her attractive 
Where are you from ? 
If you do n't have bars on the window you 're not even safe you know ? 
they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out 
and things like that and I think that it would help people to become 
That 's what I 'm saying you know I think it 's great that women have a choice today 
I 've been getting mine 
I read somewhere that the poodles is one of the the most intelligent dogs around 
and to be more responsible when you 're out on your own trying to 
And and the only reason I did it I 
And I just do n't like that 
Well that was a real farm 
we 've got the dollar Cinema in Sherman so we usually see like first-rate movies 
and it was you know It was like ki- kind of like the way we feel about going to work 
Oh at least once a week We 're we 're retired now When we working out we ate out more than that 
Because the kids just brighten up their lives 
well my goal is to try to retire by the time I 'm fifty-five 
But I do make her come in 
and the British and the French 
Okay I I have five children all together 
What kind of cats are they ? 
Hey thanks a lot I 'll talk to you later 
Well that sounds like fun 
Oh TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES 
It 's hard to say though 
everything 's free except for the food 
And so then I came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as I did fifty-one hours 
And they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not So they 
especially young kids getting out of high school 
Oh I would have liked to have a kid with me I think preferably someone seven or eight 
Do you well that makes a difference 
when that 's done and how do you feel about it ? 
That means you 're really sick if you have to use that one 
And I do n't know why that is I think it 's probably due to pricing often 
I went to college at Tech so You 've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing 
to your child 's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it 's 
and you said this was your fi- well you 'll you 'll get a couple more probably 
they do n't even consider it 
Well the only thing up here 
We were there the Brits were there 
That 's fine that 's that 's the freedom of choice 
and that 's all they know 
It 's it 's better to be employed 
that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were 
I really do n't think so 
and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used 
I think well in your words 
that that was memorable somehow I do n't know what it was 
Its building contra- or building supplies place 
Well you were in Peru ? 
And I 've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs 
If you want to go first go ahead 
Well I am new to Texas so I do n't even know what the law is 
And if you 've been in for twelve years I 'm sure you 've 
And it 's like it 's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just 
And breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway 
And they 're preoccupied with 
You have n't If you were what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers ? 
That is awful high Oh well ... 
let 's see the subject is Latin America 
I 'd like to know that you know they have friends there 
and six weeks later they 're back to work 
He said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it 's ju- completely changed his life 
franchised restaurants I I I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run 
Whatever I I do n't want to make I read it somewhere though it 's not my point I guess so 
back to the second amendment You can disagree 
You you have Fords and I I I have three Chevys which 
Oh Well he 's a bad person very definitely 
And I live I do n't make a lot of money but I live in the high price apartments simply because I feel safe here 
Well it 's very true now I 'm a New Yorker by birth 
there 's not as much slapstick anymore 
and you would think that more people would be better you know share more 
and Colorado is a beautiful place to live 
Right I imagine it is 
so all you can do is sell them as pet quality 
Since I 've got cats I decided to get some catnip 
well have we done our ten minutes 
Whenever you have a something that looks like something else 
We did not know what to do about it 
on the tracks is sh- 
Anyway well you have a good day 
I know they had it in health food stores in Plano I used live in Plano 
I mean the the counties are much larger 
Because I mean you as an individual what you do that to me is your business 
Somebody that does n't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it You mean somebody that has an actual establishment 
Or to you know do something for someone else 
I mean he 's just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much 
Industrial Marketing 
I think if it were to be if it were to be if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the ro- 
would vote pro choice 
Because they got too much at stake 
every time I visit them 
I 'm talking to you from Dallas 
back when like the Pistons were in them and now where are you calling from ? 
but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone 
You know Disney World or Disney Land 
I do n't I do n't I just do n't think you I always thought I 'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird 
I think so too But you know it 's one of those things 
You have the seven day waiting period 
Or they wo n't be as good as they could be 
hey it was not it was not a seven hour labor 
Bonus time you have a bonus ? 
so she can cover quite an area 
there 's nothing they can do about it 
and they have to shake it off 
Well I 'm I 'm here I 've got just eleven years and I do n't think I 'll ever see a a silver badge 
I think a lot of people grow up with with preconceived notions li- what the world 's about 
And I agree with that because anyone who has children that does n't really want them is n't going to be a good parent 
But I get I just could n't ima I mean it 's more money that I make in a year so 
This is a sweet Oh it is it 's a candy I 'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good 
And even though he had witnesses that said that he was at work and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not 
well that 's that 's supposed to be the trend of the future 
that 's definite security involved in in a dog like that 
Just from the heat of it all That 's one advantage you 've certainly got on us 
That 's really interesting 
then you do n't draw a line between public property and what a public symbol 
Oh it 's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year ? 
Maybe cause she got chubby again or something 
and they 're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now 
And so I think it 's kind of important that I that I you know nurture the relationship I have with my children now 
Exactly A man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries 
No we went without the kids it 's was a night out away from the children 
it is it 's really hard and 
I 've you know I 've helped out extremely well I ca n't say that but I 've helped out 
we lost a lot of our root things our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield 
Well that could be I could see where that would be important 
MUMBLEx no no go ahead 
So I understand about bass 
If it finally gets to that point 
we do most of our fishing at night 
it was a good influence for your daughter 
She said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone 
And whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume 
That 's where I 've seen it because I 've seen it off and on probably 
Have a wonderful Easter 
right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the U S 
So what do you think ? 
Definitely more to look at 
Race or nationality even 
We were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of Ju- It was just before July fourth 
is something that still bothers me It it 's 
is that typical to only breed them once ? 
They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall 
I think the sometimes I guess what did I read recently the th- the Christian point 
Well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam 
I could n't you could n't do it otherwise 
you know the the more more urban I mean less 
We 're probably about an hour away from Sharon 
That 's right That 's right 
How is your what is your feeling about expressing yourself by burning the American flag ? 
It 's I do n't see how anyone can afford it 
They found him guilty 
So that 's that 's not as bad 
They still found him guilty ? 
It 's the sad life I think today 
And that was what I was going to say It sounds like just neglect all over 
we 're not talking somebody that does six kids 
Okay Hey thanks so much for the conversation 
And it was n't very good 
And so we do n't it 's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way 
That guy that was a reporter for C N N 
but I do n't think that they 're going they 're going to change that and 
And it was n't until the last two years last year my they 're they 're a set of twins 
So I was going to go out and see what they were doing 
I think that 's just having a good time 
I 've got two older cars There both one 's a seventy-seven and one 's a seventy-eight 
have n't been that long ? 
and in the rivers and stuff ? 
to think about it and 
But today I mean you know it 's like you would n't even think of doing that 
Well I I was going to ask too does your wife work ? 
on their o within the own society 
there 's even there 's bad chemicals in those too 
I mean I guess it 'd go with my flowers 
But you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and 
I wo n't I wo n't be around that long 
Right And then you let it carry it downstream 
well you can possess 'em here too but They have to be they 're registered and like 
that would be quite a shock 
What what area did you live in ? 
no matter where you go to school 
Cause I wondered if you really you know if had any teams you like watching from up north or something 
you know what they 're what they 'd been guilty of and a lot of different things I guess 
Well I I do n't know how that would ever happen here but at least 
But I do n't think I could do it Because I 'm very very emotional 
a lot of Chinese food 
and the the British and the French mostly decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia 
Now a family I I think that like girls today have children 
enjoyed talking to you 
especially when they get like into the teenage stage 
I cry on I mean Hallmark commercials 
It just turned two I believe 
And it 's not that I mean I think everyone should have to serve on the jury 
I I I I feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know 
especially to come home and you know MUMBLEx I would have gotten in trouble the next day I 'm sure 
and he 's making a movie in I think it 's Calcutta or either India 
You know if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I 'd go to the good small restaurant
